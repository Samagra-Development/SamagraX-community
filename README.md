Building an open-source government operating system
 - Our vision is to create a layer of reusable OpenSource products for governments that will serve as a government operating system.
 - Our approach is to build sector specific govtech products using OpenSource components that can be reused across governments.
 - Our journey has given us deep insights into the need and opportunity for this approach in India. Read about our journey [here](https://samagra-development.github.io/docs/blog/ourjourney/).

This repository serves as the discussion forum for GovTech and DataGov products.
